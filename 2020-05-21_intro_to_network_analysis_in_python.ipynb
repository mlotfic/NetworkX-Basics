    "From on-line social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to transportation networks such as bike sharing systems, networks are everywhere. And knowing how to analyze them will open up a new world of possibilities for you as a data scientist. This course will equip you with the skills to analyze, visualize, and make sense of networks. You'll apply the concepts you learn to real-world network data using the powerful `NetworkX` library. With the knowledge gained in this course, you'll develop your network thinking skills and be able to look at your data with a fresh perspective."

    "\n",
    "Now that you know some basic properties of the graph and have practiced using NetworkX's drawing facilities to visualize components of it, it's time to explore how you can query it for nodes and edges. Specifically, you're going to look for \"nodes of interest\" and \"edges of interest\". To achieve this, you'll make use of the `.nodes()` and `.edges()` methods that Eric went over in the video. The `.nodes()` method returns a list of nodes, while the `.edges()` method returns a list of tuples, in which each tuple shows the nodes that are present on that edge. Recall that passing in the keyword argument data=True in these methods retrieves the corresponding metadata associated with the nodes and edges as well.\n",

    " - The _output expression_ `n` has been specified for you, along with the _iterator variables_ `n` and `d`. Your task is to fill in the _iterable_ and the _conditional expression_.\n",
    " - Use the `.nodes()` method of `T` access its nodes, and be sure to specify `data=True` to obtain the metadata for the nodes.\n",
    " - The iterator variable `d` is a dictionary. The key of interest here is `'occupation'` and value of interest is `'scientist'`.\n",
    "- Use a list comprehension to get a **list of edges** from the graph T that were formed for at least 6 years, i.e., from before **1 Jan 2010**.\n",
